## [11.0.2] - 2025-06-02

### Added

- Line labels now also have `id` attribute to improve mouse events.

## [11.0.0] - 2025-05-12

### Added

- Since it is allowed to have multiple axises per side, you can now indicate which axis a certain point/line refers to using xAxisIx and yAxisIx.

## [10.0.0] - 2024-11-29

- ~~Switch to ES Modules from CommonJS~~ Libraries should be in commonjs, for now...

## [9.0.0] - 2024-11-28

- Switch from yarn to pnpm.

## [8.1.0] - 2024-09-17

### Added

- Support for custom pixels per tick to configure how many ticks should be generated. Default is 40 px/tick as before.

## [8.0.0] - 2024-06-14

### Added

- Added support for multiple axises per side of the chart grid. The data points will always refer to the first axis of the indicated side. Migrating from old to new is simple, just change it to an array.

  Old:

  ```
  createChart({
    ...
    xAxisBottom: myXAxis,
    ...
  })
  ```

  New:

  ```
  createChart({
    ...
    xAxisesBottom: [myXAxis],
    ...
  })
  ```

- Added `axisWidth` for customizing the width of the axises.
- Added support for data axises, a separately rendered axis type whose tick labels are a function values. Just supply some points defining the function These are rendered outside of the normal axises.

### Changed

- Padding is now additional space outside of the rendered elements, so the layout from left to right is now like this, the x-axises and paddings and heights are calculated in the same manner:

  1. Empty space defined by `padding.left`.
  2. One data axis per `chartDataAxisesLeft` in reverse order, each `axisWidth` wide.
  3. One data axis per `yAxisesLeft` in reverse order, each `axisWidth` wide.
  4. Grid area filling up remaining space.
  5. One data axis per `yAxisesRight` in normal order, each `axisWidth` wide.
  6. One data axis per `chartDataAxisesRight` in normal order, each `axisWidth` wide.
  7. Empty space defined by `padding.right`.

## [7.4.1] - 2024-05-29

### Changed

- Updated rendering of chart lines to be clipped within chart bounds

## [7.2.0] - 2024-05-22

### Added

## [7.1.0] - 2024-05-10

### Changed

## [7.0.0] - 2024-05-06

### Added

- Chart padding
- Overridable font sizes for all texts.
- Discrete axises
- Rotate tick labels
- Disp tick labels

### Changed

- Separate x-grid & y-grid
- Separate styling of all axises
- Previous chart padding was {top: 40, right: 80, bottom: 40, left: 80}. New default padding is depending on axises.

### Example migrate 6 -> 7

- { ... gridColor: AI.black; gridThickness: 1; ... } ->
  { ... xGrid: { color: AI.black; thickness: 1 }, yGrid: { color: AI.black; thickness: 1 }, yGrid: { color: AI.black; thickness: 1 }, xAxisBottom: {... axisColor: AI.black, thickness: 1 ...}, yAxisLeft: {... axisColor: AI.black, thickness: 1 ...} ... };
- { ... ... } - > { ... padding: {top: 40, right: 80, bottom: 40, left: 80} ... }
